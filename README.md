### Writing PRs

To get the most out of Reviewington you should write PR's that follow our recommended [PR Comment Etiquette](/docs/pr_etiquette.md).

If you want a PR comment to be ignored by Reviewington you can prepend it with the custom tag `NA:`, this ensures that the PR comment will not be picked up while processing.
This is different from having a non-existent tag, which will still be picked up by Reviewington but with the default PR tag of `null`.
